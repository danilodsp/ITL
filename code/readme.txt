The demos use mex files (code written in C) to speed up calculations. There are already windows and mac (unix) versions of each function compiled in each directory. If you have problems running some of the demos, it us probably because incompatibilities among versions of the matlab or the OS itself. There are small instructions in each file to compile your own version. Please refer to it in case you need.

If you have any questions, you can contact me at allan@dee.ufrn.br

I hope this demos help you to understand a little more the concept of ITL.
